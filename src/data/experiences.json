    "experience": "It has been nothing short of exceptional. A unique trait about Lakshya is that both the kids and the volunteers seem to match each other's energy. It has a committed and vibrant community of volunteers that gladly accepted me as one of their own.\n\nTeaching here has been very fulfilling, and I could see a marked improvement in speech, writing, and language usage with my kids. On the last day, my kids ran up to me with a thank-you note they had prepared, which they sang in unison. After that, one of them broke down in tears and said she had never had a teacher like me.\n\nA moving revelation that Lakshya gave me was that even the few hours of a busy week that I've been putting in could mean a great deal to someone else.",

I also encouraged critical thinking and problem-solving, equipping them with skills beyond the classroom.\n\nThe community has been incredibly supportive and welcoming, making it feel like a second home. Beyond the classroom, the bonds formed through after-class outings, volunteer bonding sessions, and shared experiences have been truly special. Whether it was getting to know fellow volunteers, organizing events like the Science Fair, End-of-Year celebrations, and Christmas festivities, or simply spending time at Lakshya, every moment has been filled with joy and fulfillment. The warmth of this community has made my journey at U&I not just about volunteering but about belonging, growing, and creating lasting memories.\n\nForever grateful for this experience.",

And if you're feeling the exact same way now, TRUST ME, it's a part of the process.\n\nMy days spent at Lakshya feel like home. Interacting with the kids, watching them grow through the months, playing games with them, and becoming a child again around them - you are going to love every bit of it.\n\nIf I still have not sold you this, Lakshya apart from teaching, also has amazing community-building activities. You're going to meet like-minded people you can chill with, learn from, and bond over crazy stuff.\n\nOn weekends, whether you're busy or free, Lakshya is the place to be <3",

    "experience": "When I first joined Lakshya, I was skeptical. Teaching kids with little to no background in English felt daunting, especially when I realized they hadn’t been exposed to parts of speech, tenses, or even basic spellings—despite being in high school. The learning gap was significant, and overcoming it took time, patience, and countless revisions. But today, when I look back, I see real progress. They’ve grown, they’ve improved, and knowing that I played a part in that transformation fills me with joy.\n\nInitially, I joined with the intention of ‘giving back to society,’ but I stayed for the people. I still remember the first few days when I wanted to leave the center as soon as classes ended, avoiding debriefs and small talk. But over time, that changed. Moments like Children’s Day, where a simple game of guessing childhood pictures turned into unexpected fun, made me realize how much I enjoyed being part of this community. I started staying back, made new friends, and found a sense of belonging. I won’t say I connect with everyone equally, but I’ve met some truly good people here, and that’s something I’ll always cherish.\n\nChristmas was another highlight. The amount of planning, effort, and teamwork that went into making it a success was incredible. And seeing the kids’ happiness? That was the icing on the cake.\n\nBut everything was not perfect, as it rarely is. Here are some things I noticed: Leadership works best when shared, ensuring no one is overburdened. Titles should come with commitment and accountability, with leaders actively contributing. While volunteer efforts vary, recognizing dedication and encouraging collective responsibility will strengthen the center.\n\nYet, despite the challenges, we’ve achieved so much together—whether it was pulling off incredible events, organizing an unforgettable Christmas, or driving successful crowdfunding efforts.\n\nFor all of this—for the growth, the impact, the friendships, and the lessons—I am grateful. Lakshya has given me experiences I will carry forward, and I leave this year knowing that, in many ways, it has shaped me as much as I’ve helped shape it.",

    "experience": "It all started on July 7th when I was added to the Lakshya Group — yeah, the name was decided later, but still. I was kind of in a dilemma about whether to continue, and I had a ton of questions running through my mind: How many people would be there? Will they judge me? What if I get nervous?— because honestly, I was pretty scared of crowds. But then I thought, *Chalo, jo hoga dekha jayega*.\n\nThen came July 13th — our first official icebreaker session. I was near Mathruchhaya, waiting for someone to show up, when I saw Tejas and Tia walking towards me. I recognized Tejas, and after the usual *Hello, how are you* stuff, the class and debrief went surprisingly well. That’s also the day I saw a 10th-grade kid who didn’t know any grammar at all. I remember thinking, *How come anta?* But again, *Chalo, jo hoga dekha jayega* — and I just moved on.  \n\nI even remember mentioning during my interview that my class should be completely digital. Kids remember what they see more than what they hear, right? But here, it was the opposite — we weren’t allowed to use phones or laptops unless absolutely necessary. I was clueless about what to do next. Then I remembered my PU days, when my lecturers would give us printed notes. I borrowed that approach, and it worked like magic with my kids.\n\nAs days passed, Lakshya became more of a family than just a group of college students trying to help kids. In the early days, I used to rush off right after the debriefs, but now we spend hours together even after class. That constant feeling of *Ghar jaake kya hi karenge, idhar rukha toh ye kamine log honge, kuch bakchodi hoga* (*What’s the point of going home when I could just stay back and have fun with these idiots*) remains unchanged!\n\nI knew I had done something meaningful when I received the *Outstanding Teacher Award*. I still remember asking, *Me? Aaa…?* — not once, but three times when they called my name. That moment is permanently imprinted in my brain cells.\n\nI thought Lakshya would be more of a tutoring program, but it turned out to be so much more — especially during *Children's Day x Christmas*. That event was such a success that even leaders from across Bangalore showed up to cheer us on. Lakshya became a brand — a benchmark — and people started recognizing that our volunteers were something special.\n\nThen I was chosen as a coach for crowdfunding. Initially, I thought it would be pretty simple, but it turned out to be tough. Managing a group of people with busy schedules and getting them to participate in crowdfunding activities wasn’t easy. Not every volunteer had the same level of enthusiasm, but thankfully, some stepped up and took responsibility at just the right time.\n\nI joined U&I with the intention of teaching on Saturdays and heading home afterward. But it turned out so differently. I met people from other centers, found another place that feels like home, and made more friends I now consider family. I got a great teaching buddy, an always-dependable friend, and even a *Rotighar hogana* (*Let’s go for food*) friend! More than I could have ever imagined.\n\nLike, who would have thought that a TL could be so sweet, approving everything I say? It feels amazing when people open up about their daily lives and get excited to meet each other every week. The leaders have done an incredible job — not just with the classes but in creating a genuine comfort zone for all of us. Hats off to them for having such patience and understanding every volunteer in such a short time.\n\nI can’t believe it’s already ending. Eight months went by way too fast. It’s true what they say — *It’s pretty scary how quickly time flies.*❤️",

    "experience": "As a first-time teacher volunteer, my heart is full when I look back at my journey in Lakshya. There were so many reasons to show up every single week at the center. The kids, volunteers, and leaders made this whole journey exciting. When I joined, I did not know the rollercoaster of emotions I would experience by the end of it. Every person I have met has been welcoming, and every interaction with someone brought me closer to the community and what we were able to do together as Lakshya.\n\nThe enthusiasm of the kids to learn more and their expectation for you to show up every week, because they do too, makes you never want to miss a class. Every event that took place at the center brought the volunteers closer, irrespective of their backgrounds. Over time, a space was created where you could share your perspective without feeling judged, which really impressed me.\n\nSpeaking from my experience and after listening to fellow volunteers, I understood that you are in for a journey of self-growth. Another thing to appreciate about the center is its leaders. Every leader brought their strengths to the table and made sure to keep the community engaging and fun at all times. The overall atmosphere was always warm and approachable, which made a huge difference. I never hesitated to ask for support when I needed it. The leaders were constantly coming up with creative ways to engage the kids, which opened up our perspectives.\n\nCreative teaching was something new for many of us, so this push helped us step out of our comfort zones and try fresh, innovative approaches. Looking back, it was this encouragement that made all the difference, shaping us into more confident and adaptable volunteers.\n\nLooking back at everything, I now realize how much this experience has shaped me. The encouragement, the sense of belonging, and the friendships I built here made all the difference. Lakshya has given me so much more than I ever expected, and I will always be grateful for every moment I have spent here. My time at the center will always hold a special place in my heart, and I know that these memories, the lessons I have learned, and the people I have met will stay with me for the rest of my life.",

I was very nervous about how I would impart knowledge to someone.\n\n Next week, I was mapped to 2 kids, and I thought it would be a really big responsibility. We started out, and the kids were shy at first but started opening up to me. They shared their school life, their family life, and at the end of the class, they told me that if they had a choice, they would come to Lakshya every day just to be taught by the volunteers here, and not go to school at all. That made me so happy, and it's a cherishable memory that I will hold forever. ❤",

We were a new center, with all new set of volunteers, leaders and kids. Managing volunteers, ensuring smooth operations, and creating a lasting impact on the kids felt like a big responsibility. 'Could we actually do it all?' I felt doubt if I could balance it alongside my other commitments.\n\nBut then, something amazing happened; as the first month passed, the team came together in the most natural way possible. We weren't just a group of individuals meeting once a week for 2 hours; it became something more. A support system that made every success even more rewarding. The energy and passion of everyone around me didn’t just motivate me, it made me WANT to do more. I didn’t just want to fulfill my role; I wanted to go beyond, to push boundaries, and to bring everything I had to the table for Lakshya 🔥.\n\nLooking back, I can say with certainty. Agreeing to this was the best decision I have taken till date :) The fun we had, the connections we built, and, most importantly, the impact we created together on the kids made every bit of effort worth it.
