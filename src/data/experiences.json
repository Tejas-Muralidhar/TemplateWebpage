    "experience": "From the very beginning, Lakshya felt like something special :) When we started back in July, I knew it had the potential to be impactful, but I wasnâ€™t sure how everything would come together. We were a new center, with all new set of volunteers, leaders and kids. Managing volunteers, ensuring smooth operations, and creating a lasting impact on the kids felt like a big responsibility. 'Could we actually do it all?' I felt doubt if I could balance it alongside my other commitments.\n\nBut then, something amazing happened; as the first month passed, the team came together in the most natural way possible. We weren't just a group of individuals meeting once a week for 2 hours; it became something more. A support system that made every success even more rewarding. The energy and passion of everyone around me didnâ€™t just motivate me, it made me WANT to do more. I didnâ€™t just want to fulfill my role; I wanted to go beyond, to push boundaries, and to bring everything I had to the table for Lakshya ðŸ”¥.\n\nLooking back, I can say with certainty. Agreeing to this was the best decision I have taken till date :) The fun we had, the connections we built, and, most importantly, the impact we created together on the kids made every bit of effort worth it. Leading Lakshya wasnâ€™t just about running a center; it was about being part of something bigger, something that will stay with me long after my time here ends.",
